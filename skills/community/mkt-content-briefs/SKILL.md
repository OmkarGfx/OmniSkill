# Content Briefs

*Part of the Problem → Solution → Communicate framework. Executes the **Communicate** phase — turning IMC plans into production-ready content.*

Transform IMC plan outputs (angles, channels, pillars) into **production-ready creative content**—complete with written copy, hooks, scripts, and CTAs. The production team only needs to design/produce the visuals.

## Philosophy

- **Platform-native content** beats generic posts
- **Complete copy** beats placeholder text
- **Specific CTAs** beat "learn more"
- Content should **advance KPIs**, not just fill feeds
- Every piece serves a purpose in the **awareness journey**

## Before Starting

Check if they have an IMC plan. If not, suggest `mkt-imc` first or gather:
- **Angle** with hook type, trigger, awareness stage
- **Channel** (native + type + name)
- **Pillar** context
- **Voice/tone** guidelines

Ask: *"Do you have an IMC plan with angles and channel allocation? If not, what angle and channel are we creating content for?"*

---

## The Flow

```
IMC Plan → Select Angle/Channel → Distribution Target → Content Specification → Write Full Copy → Production Guidelines
```

---

## Phase 1: Select from IMC Plan

If they have an IMC plan, pull from the allocation table.

Ask: *"Which angle from your IMC plan are we creating content for? Which channel?"*

Need:

| Element | Source | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Angle** | Allocation table | "Teams waste 5hrs/week on status updates" |
| **Hook Type** | Angle bank | Data |
| **Trigger** | Angle bank | Frustration |
| **Stage** | Angle bank | Problem Aware |
| **Pillar** | Pillar table | Productivity |
| **Channel Native** | Allocation | LinkedIn |
| **Channel Type** | Allocation | Owned |
| **Channel Name** | Allocation | @brand |
| **Voice/Tone** | Strategy Foundation | Direct, data-backed |

---

## Phase 2: Distribution Target

Confirm the exact placement and pull platform specs.

### Step 1: Confirm Channel Details

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Channel Native | [X/TikTok/Instagram/LinkedIn/YouTube/etc.] |
| Channel Type | [Owned/Partner/Paid KOL/Ecosystem/Earned] |
| Channel Name | [Specific account] |
| Placement | [Feed/Stories/Reels/Thread/Carousel/etc.] |

### Step 2: Pull Platform Specs

Reference [platform-specs.md](references/platform-specs.md) for:
- Aspect ratio and resolution
- Max duration or character count
- Caption/subtitle requirements
- Audio specs
- Safe areas
- Platform-native patterns

Example output:

| Spec | Value |
|------|-------|
| Platform | TikTok |
| Placement | In-feed video |
| Aspect Ratio | 9:16 (1080x1920) |
| Duration | 15-60 seconds |
| Captions | Required (burned in or native) |
| Audio | Music/voice allowed, trending sounds boost reach |
| Safe Area | Top 150px (username), bottom 270px (buttons) |

---

## Phase 3: Content Specification

Derive the content spec from the angle and channel.

### Purpose (from Awareness Stage)

| Stage | Content Purpose | Goal |
|-------|-----------------|------|
| Unaware | Surface the problem | Make them say "I didn't realize..." |
| Problem Aware | Validate and agitate | Make them say "This is exactly my struggle" |
| Solution Aware | Differentiate | Make them say "This is different because..." |
| Product Aware | Overcome objections | Make them say "My concern was X, but..." |
| Most Aware | Drive action | Make them say "I'm ready to..." |

### Content Type (from Hook Type)

| Hook Type | Content Type | Format Pattern |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|
| Question | Curiosity-driven | Open with question, reveal answer |
| Bold claim | Thesis-driven | State claim, back with proof |
| How-to | Educational | Step-by-step, actionable |
| Story | Narrative | Setup, conflict, resolution |
| Data | Evidence-driven | Numbers first, context second |
| Sneak peek | Exclusive reveal | Behind the scenes, insider access |
| Contrarian | Counter-narrative | Common belief vs. reality |
| Analogy | Explainer | Complex → simple comparison |

### Format (from Channel Native)

Match format to platform patterns. See [platform-specs.md](references/platform-specs.md).

### Narrative Throughline

One sentence that captures the journey:

> "[Target audience] thinks [current belief], but [angle insight] because [reason], so they should [action]."

Example:
> "Engineering managers think adding headcount fixes slow shipping, but process bottlenecks cause most delays because code review queues and unclear ownership stall PRs, so they should map their actual workflow before hiring."

---

## Phase 4: Content Creation (Full Copy)

Write the complete creative—not specs, not placeholders, but actual copy ready for production.

### Hook (First 3 Seconds / First Line)

The hook stops the scroll. Write the exact text.

| Hook Type | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Question | "Have you ever [relatable experience]?" | "Have you ever spent more time reporting on work than doing it?" |
| Bold claim | "[Controversial statement]" | "Your team doesn't have a productivity problem. You have a meetings problem." |
| How-to | "How to [outcome] without [sacrifice]" | "How to ship 2x faster without hiring" |
| Story | "I [action] and [unexpected result]" | "I cut our meetings by 80% and output doubled" |
| Data | "[Surprising number/stat]" | "The average employee spends 31 hours/month in unproductive meetings" |
| Sneak peek | "Here's what [insiders] actually do" | "Here's what high-performing eng teams actually measure" |
| Contrarian | "Stop [common advice]" | "Stop tracking velocity. Track this instead." |

**For video:** Write the opening line/visual exactly as it appears on screen or is spoken.

**For static/carousel:** Write the headline/title text.

**For threads:** Write the first tweet.

### Body/Script

Write the complete content—not an outline, the actual copy.

**For video scripts:**

```
[0:00-0:03] HOOK
Text on screen: "[Hook text]"
Voiceover: "[What they say]"
Visual: [What's shown]

[0:03-0:15] SETUP
Text on screen: "[Text]"
Voiceover: "[Script]"
Visual: [Description]

[0:15-0:45] MAIN CONTENT
...

[0:45-0:60] CTA
Text on screen: "[CTA text]"
Voiceover: "[Script]"
Visual: [Final frame]
```

**For static posts:**

Write the complete caption—every word that will be posted.

**For carousels:**

Write every slide:
- Slide 1: [Cover/Hook]
- Slide 2: [Content]
- ...
- Final slide: [CTA]

**For threads:**

Write every post:
- 1/ [First tweet with hook]
- 2/ [Second tweet]
- ...
- [Final tweet with CTA]

### CTA (Call to Action)

Write the exact CTA—what they click, tap, or do.

| Stage | CTA Pattern | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Unaware | Learn more | "See why this matters →" |
| Problem Aware | Explore | "Discover the fix →" |
| Solution Aware | Compare | "See how we're different →" |
| Product Aware | Try | "Start free trial →" |
| Most Aware | Act | "Start now →" |

Include:
- **CTA text:** The exact button/link text
- **Destination:** Where it goes
- **Tracking:** UTM or attribution notes

### Caption (if applicable)

For platforms with separate caption fields (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube), write the complete caption:

```
[First line hooks in feed preview]

[Body copy - expand on the content]

[CTA - what to do next]

[Hashtags if applicable]
```

---

## Phase 5: Production Guidelines

Give the production team everything they need.

### Visual Direction

Describe the visual style without creating the visuals:

- **Mood:** [Energetic/Calm/Professional/Playful/etc.]
- **Color palette:** [Brand colors to emphasize]
- **Typography:** [Bold headlines/Clean minimalist/etc.]
- **Imagery style:** [Screenshots/Motion graphics/Talking head/B-roll/etc.]
- **Key visual elements:** [Charts, UI mockups, product shots, etc.]

### Brand Tone Adaptation

## Working with Multiple Pieces

When creating content batches:

### From One Angle → Multiple Formats

Repurpose systematically:

```
HERO: [Primary format for this angle]
├── DERIVATIVE 1: [Format]
├── DERIVATIVE 2: [Format]
└── DERIVATIVE 3: [Format]

MICRO:
├── [Format]
├── [Format]
└── [Format]
```

### Content Calendar View

For batch briefs, organize by publish date:

| Date | Angle | Channel | Format | Hook Preview | Status |
|------|-------|---------|--------|--------------|--------|
| [Date] | [Angle] | [Channel] | [Format] | [First few words] | [Draft/Ready] |

---

## Examples

See [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for complete worked examples with full copy:

- **B2B SaaS:** LinkedIn carousel with all slide copy
- **D2C Brand:** TikTok video script with full dialogue
- **B2B SaaS:** X thread with complete post sequence

---

## Next Steps

After creating content briefs, use `mkt-attribution` to map each content piece to its initiative and KPI. This verifies every piece you're producing advances your goals and flags orphan content.

## How to Work

- **Write the actual copy**, not descriptions of copy
- **Be specific**, not generic—"Link in bio" isn't a CTA
- **Match platform patterns**—what works on TikTok doesn't work on LinkedIn
- **Include everything** production needs—they shouldn't have to guess
- **Reference the angle's metadata**—hook type, trigger, stage should shape the content
- Ask questions if the angle or channel isn't clear
- Adapt voice for channel while staying on-brand
